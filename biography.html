        <h2>Hi, my name is Kai Brooks and I am a recent college graduate and UX Designer raised in the world of international humanitarian organizations. From a very young age I had a deep passion for helping others.<br>
          While obtaining my B.A in International Affairs I worked with CARE USA focusing my efforts in advocacy and human resources. At CARE I broadened my knowledge of international humanitarian issues as well as understanding people. This deepened my curiosity for the world and led me to pursue my studies abroad.<br>
          My studies abroad were focused on global politics, anthropology, and environmental sustainability. My passion for helping others intensified greatly. Upon my return home to Atlanta I discovered my passion for design. UX design allows me to add a positive impact in peopleâ€™s lives. I love that I can use my creativity to find solutions. It is my passion to make the world more beautiful, one project at a time.</h2>
