          <h3><u>Problem</u></h3>
          <p>Today plant-based diets are quite popular. While there are many apps that cater to this diet, there is not an app that accommodates all of the user’s needs in one place. There is not an app that allows the user to search for recipes not only by specific plant-based diets, but search for recipes by ingredient, create recipes in app, create shopping lists, and create reminders to cook.</p>

          <h3><u>Solution</u></h3>
          <p>Happy Carrot is a plant-based recipe app allowing users to search, create, and share recipes. Happy Carrot also allows users to search for recipes by ingredient.  Happy Carrot is a free app that provides a large amount of recipes and accommodates numerous plant-based diets.</p>

          <h3><u>Research</u></h3>
          <p>The first step was to complete a SWOT Analysis by analyzing competitors Oh She Glows, Forks Over Knives, and Yummly. I chose these apps because they are most popular in the healthy eating apps. All three of these apps cater to clean diets. </p>

          <h3><u>Analysis</u></h3>
          <p>The survey focused on these aspects:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Do you cook by/for yourself or do you cook with/for somebody else?</li>
            <li>How often do you cook?</li>
            <li>How important is eating healthy for you?</li>
            <li>How often do you know exactly what you want to cook?</li>
            <li>When grocery shopping do you know exactly what you want to prepare before buying groceries or do you just buy the essential products and then figure out what to cook?</li>
            <li>Do you create your own recipes?</li>
          </ul>
          <p>With the discoveries found through my survey, I was able to move forward to creating solutions. It was clear that users want: </p>

            <h3><u>User Stories</u></h3>
            <p>After completing the competitive analysis and user research I was able to construct informed User Stories. To construct the user stories I compiled a list of tasks new and returning users would need to complete when they would visit the app. After listing the tasks, I ordered them from highest to lowest priority.</p>

        <div class="hcuserflows">
          <h3><u>User Flows</u></h3>
          <p>User stories help me understand how the app will flow. I took the high priority tasks from my user stories and turned them into User Flows. These help me visualize the processes that need to be completed in the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) such as searching for a recipe, creating a recipe, and creating a new recipe.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="hccentercard">
          <h3><u>Wireframes</u></h3>
          <p>Once I completed the user flows, I began constructing the Content Strategy (Happy Carrot) for the website. I wanted to make sure the website flowed nicely with a colorful, elegant theme. so the copy was written to reflect that. Other content planned for the website included photos to be used for illustrative elements.</p>
          <p>The next step was to create the Wireframe Sketches (HC). I began by making sketches of the wireframes with pencil and paper. Once I had a strong idea of the design, I translated the sketches to Figma and tested them with a few users. The User Testing on the wireframes received very helpful feedback. This feedback helped me to start designing my high-fidelity prototype. </p>

          <h3><u>Branding</u></h3>
          <h4>Bright, playful, and fun</h4>
          <p>I started the Branding Research by first sketching the logo using pen and pencil. This way I was able to quickly iterate and make as many changes as possible. I wanted the logo to embody all of the brand words.</p>

          <h3><u>High-Fidelity Mockups</u></h3>
          <p>The Style Guide helped me create high-fidelity mockups for the app. These are the initial mockups adapted from my wireframe sketches. </p>

        <div class="hcbackground">
          <h3><u>User Testing Results</u></h3>
          <p>The ultimate user test was for the high-fidelity mockup. This was tested with three users to get their feedback. I made minor changes based on the preference test. </p>
          <p>I created the InVision Prototype using and tested it with my users. Overall everyone liked the design of the app</p>
          <p>I tested the users ability to complete the following tasks: </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Sign Up/In</li>
            <li>Search for a recipe</li>
            <li>Create a new recipe</li>
            <li>Create a new shopping list</li>
            <li>Set a reminder to cook a recipe</li>
          </ul>
          <p>I found that the users needed an easier way to identify the most important buttons such as sign up, create, and share. The users suggested the addition of minor changes such as:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Remove logo from internal pages and replace with swipe bar to navigate back to homepage/search/recipes</li>
            <li>Remove account icon from bottom nav bar</li>
            <li>Add slide navigation bar to homepage to navigate to recipes and search page</li>
            <li>Add drop down menu to create a new recipe</li>
            <li>Add dark background to menu on homepage</li>
            <li>Add menu to recipe page with remind to cook button</li>
            <li>Add search by category and search by cuisine option to search page</li>
            <li>Add a cancel button to remind to cook pop up</li>
            <li>Decrease font size of page headers to match Diet and Allergies heading size</li>
            <li>Add back buttons to all recipe pages</li>
            <li>Add a cancel button on create new recipe page</li>
            <li>Remove grey enter username/password text on sign in/up page due to redundancy</li>
            <li>Anchor recipe plus sign to top right of page</li>
            <li>Turn create new list page into modal view</li>
            <li>Add back buttons to pages to navigate to homepage</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="hcconclusion">
          <h3><u>Conclusion</u></h3>
          <p>The process of creating Happy Carrot was positive and negative. I was most pleased to receive extensive feedback from the usability testing.  Without these insights the app would have suffered. When creating Happy Carrot I found the transition from wireframes to mockups challenging.</p>
          <p>When working on the initial mockups I discovered that my wireframes lacked proper navigation. Even though I wanted to create a solution at the time, I digitized the wireframes and relied on user testing to provide direction. When tested, users were also confused on how to navigate between pages, but provided helped suggestions on how to improve this issue by adding a swipe navigation feature for the homepage. </p>
          <p>Creating the branding for Happy Carrot was also a bit challenging as I suffered a small drawback. I struggled mostly to decide on the name and logo of the app.  At first I was overwhelmed by the variety of vegetables I could use to represent the brand. Ultimately I decided to use a smiling carrot to symbolize the joy of healthy eating. I chose to match the color scheme with the carrot.  As a result I was quite surprised that the brand took on a playful, colorful tone. </p>
          <p>These challenges made me more aware of what needs to be done In the future. Next time I will make sure to add more detail in our low fidelity mockups. This project made me realize that I am a perfectionist to some degree. I could have just designed a chopping block for the logo for Happy Carrot to save time, but I was not satisfied with the design. I also learned that without user feedback, a successful user experience is not possible. </p>
